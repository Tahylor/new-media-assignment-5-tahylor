                        This is a website I made in my Web Design 1 class from last semester for my final project in that class.  The website I created was for a jewelry and skincare company.  I used html and css to create the site.  This website isn't perfect, but I am beyond proud of myself for the final project.

                        This is a website I created using Wordpress.  I made this for my Integrated Media 1 class last semester.  My teacher did not give us any tips on how to use Wordpress, so I did not know what I doing when I created my website.  There is a lot I don't know about Wordpress, but in time I hope to gain more experience and get better at using the platform.

                    This website was a guided project from my Web Design 1 class.  I used html and css to create this site.  This website is where I first learned to use css.
